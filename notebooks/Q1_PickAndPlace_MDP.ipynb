    "We want to model a robot arm “pick and place” task as a Reinforcement Learning problem. The robot controls motors directly, and it receives feedback about positions and velocities. The agent should learn movements that are **fast** and **smooth**.\n",

    "#### **Conclusion/Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested a simple pick-and-place task by modeling it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and running a scripted rollout. The goal was not to train an intelligent agent yet, but to check whether the environment, rewards, and step-by-step behavior work correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The episode finished successfully at step 90, with the object placed very close to the goal (final distance 0.0467). When the task was completed, the system gave a large positive reward, which led to a final total reward of 8.61. This shows that the environment correctly detects success and ends the episode at the right time.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the distance-to-goal graph, we can see that once the object was picked up, it steadily moved closer to the target without sudden jumps or instability. This tells us that the environment’s movement and state updates are smooth and reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reward plots show small negative rewards during most steps, which encourages the agent to finish the task quickly. Only completing the task gives a strong positive reward. This confirms that the reward design properly discourages unnecessary actions and rewards meaningful completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "The action-magnitude plot shows larger movements early in the episode and smaller, more careful actions near the goal. This indicates stable and sensible control behavior as the task progresses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this rollout confirms that:\n",
    "* The environment behaves consistently from step to step\n",
    "* Rewards correctly reflect progress and success\n",
    "* Episode termination works as expected"
