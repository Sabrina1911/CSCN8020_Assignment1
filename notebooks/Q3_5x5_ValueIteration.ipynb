    "Both standard (synchronous) and in-place value iteration converged to the same optimal solution (V* and π*) in 9 sweeps. With snapshot logging enabled every sweep, measured runtimes were 0.069475 s (standard) and 0.142434 s (in-place); this difference is mainly due to per-iteration file I/O overhead rather than algorithmic differences. Since Value Iteration is DP (not episodic), the reported “episodes” correspond to sweeps until convergence. Time complexity is O(K·|S|·|A|) and space is O(|S|) (standard VI uses an extra temporary V array but remains linear)."
