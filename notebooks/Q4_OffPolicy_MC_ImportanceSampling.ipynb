    "#### **Analysis/Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Q4, we solved the same 5×5 Gridworld from Q3 using two different approaches: a model-based method (Value Iteration) and a model-free method (Off-policy Monte Carlo with Weighted Importance Sampling).\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is identical to Q3: deterministic transitions, four actions, a goal at (4,4), grey penalty states, reward-on-arrival (+10 goal, −5 grey, −1 otherwise), and discount factor γ = 0.9.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, Value Iteration was run as a baseline. Because it has access to the full transition model, it performs deterministic Bellman sweeps over all states. It converged in only 9 iterations and required approximately 0.0011 seconds, demonstrating the efficiency of model-based dynamic programming in small tabular environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Off-policy Monte Carlo learned purely from sampled episodes generated by a random behavior policy. Using Weighted Importance Sampling to stabilize updates, it required 100,000 episodes and approximately 7.8 million transitions, taking about 11.85 seconds of runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the significantly higher computational effort, Monte Carlo successfully approximated the optimal value function. The maximum absolute difference between the estimated value function and the optimal value function from Value Iteration was only 0.0312, which is very small relative to the scale of rewards in the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a computational complexity perspective:\n",
    "* Value Iteration scales as O(K · |S| · |A|), where K is the number of sweeps.\n",
    "* Off-policy Monte Carlo scales as O(E · L), where E is the number of episodes and L is the average episode length.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this experiment shows that while model-free learning can approximate the optimal solution, it requires substantially more data and computation compared to model-based methods when the environment dynamics are known. In this small, fully specified Gridworld, Value Iteration is clearly more efficient. However, Off-policy Monte Carlo remains valuable because it does not require knowledge of the transition model and can therefore be applied to environments where the dynamics are unknown."
