    "\n",
    "A small 2×2 Gridworld Markov Decision Process was analyzed using two iterations of value iteration. The goal was not to find a fully optimal solution, but to clearly show how values and actions evolve when the Bellman update rule is applied step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The environment is simple and deterministic. Each state has a fixed reward, and every action leads to a predictable next state. A high discount factor of 0.98 was used, which means that future rewards that are close in time are valued almost as much as immediate rewards, while rewards further away have slightly less influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Iteration 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The value function was initially set to zero for all states. Because of this, the first iteration has a very straightforward outcome. With no future information available yet, each state’s value becomes equal to its immediate reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly what the results show:\n",
    "* s1 gets a value of 5\n",
    "* s2 gets a value of 10\n",
    "* s3 gets a value of 1\n",
    "* s4 gets a value of 2\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, the agent has no reason to prefer one direction over another based on long-term outcomes. Each state only reflects what it gives immediately. This confirms that the initialization and reward setup are working correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Understanding Iteration 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second iteration, the values from Iteration 1 are used to evaluate future outcomes. Now, actions matter because they determine which state the agent will reach next.\n",
    "\n",
    "A clear pattern emerges:\n",
    "* State s2 has the highest reward and also allows the agent to remain in s2 when moving up or right.\n",
    "* Because of this, s2’s value increases significantly.\n",
    "* States that can move toward s2 also improve.\n",
    "  - s1 improves by moving right to s2.\n",
    "  - s4 improves by moving up to s2.\n",
    "* State s3 improves more slowly because it is farther from s2.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Iteration 2, the values increase in a way that reflects how close each state is to the high-reward state s2. This demonstrates how value iteration propagates reward information through the state space.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Policy Behavior**\n",
    "\n",
    "The greedy policy derived after Iteration 2 consistently chooses actions that move the agent toward s2. This makes intuitive sense because s2 offers the highest long-term return. The policy is not forced or hard-coded; it naturally emerges from the value updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the results clearly demonstrate how value iteration works in practice. Values start simple, then gradually incorporate future rewards as iterations progress. High-reward states influence nearby states first, and optimal actions emerge naturally from the value function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final values, Q-table, matrix view, and policy grid are all consistent with one another and with the Bellman update principle. "
